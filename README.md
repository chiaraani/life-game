This game represents a population of cells and its development. Cells are arranged in a grid. Cells die by overpopulation or underpopulation next to them. Cells are born if population is ideal.

You can choose number of rows and columns of grid by filling in the form. Also, you can choose number of phases of development and how long phases last. Play the video below to watch an example of execution.
